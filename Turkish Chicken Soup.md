[Source](https://youtu.be/rdJS-w6rXjY?si=fAmEX3qntRzJVVoZ)

- 4 boneless skinless chicken thigh, 400-450 g
- 4 cloves of garlic, 2 whole and 2 grated 
- 1.7 liters of hot water
- 1 heaped teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion
- 2 packs of tomato puree, 400 g
- 140 g (4 handful) vermicelli or spaghetti 
- 2 small dry chili peppers, halved
- 20 sprigs of parsley, roughly chopped
- Big walnut sized ginger, grated
- Small finger sized turmeric, grated
- 1 lemon, quartered
- 1 pinch of chili pepper flakes
- 1 pinch of black pepper

1. Place the chicken thigh, half of the onion, 2 cloves of garlic, black peppercorns and hot water in the pressure cooker. If you want you can also put some bay leaves. Close the lid and turn the heat up. Cook on high pressure reduce the heat and cook for another 8-10 minutes after the whistle has locked. Then release the pressure of the pot and open the lid.
1. Chop the other half of the onion. Pour olive oil into another pot and caramelize the onions by closing the lid. 
1. Add garlic, ginger, turmeric and tomato puree, give it a mix and close the lid. 
1. When the chickens are cooked, take out the chickens from the pot. Stiff the excess water to the other pot and shred the chickens with a mixer. Also add the shredded chickens, salt and dry cayenne pepper.
1. At this step add vermicelli to the soup. But if you donâ€™t have vermicelli in your home you can break some spaghetti in a clean towel by using the edge of the counter. 
Add the parsley, chili pepper flakes and black pepper when the soup is boiling and simmer it for about 5-6 minutes.
1. When serving, pour some soup into a bowl. Squeeze some lemon drops, add some chopped parsley more and red pepper flakes if you want a little more spice.
