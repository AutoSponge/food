# Tomatillo Salsa

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPA2nQpnkFA)

▪450g or 1lb ripe tomatillos, halved or quartered
▪125g or about 1/2c red onion, diced small
▪50g or about 1/2c poblano pepper, diced small
▪3 garlic cloves (minced or pressed)
▪5g or 3/4-1 tsp salt
▪50g or 1/4c water

Place ingredients in a sauté pan over medium high. When tomatillos start to become juicy, cover, reduce heat to medium, and cook for an additional 10-15min until salsa is saucy, tender, and well broken down. Allow to cool.
