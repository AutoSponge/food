# Vegan Buffalo Chickpea Dip

Source

1 cup raw cashews (or I’ve used almonds in the past with no effect on flavor)
1 can cannellini beans
1/2 cup nondairy milk
3/4 cup hot sauce
Pepper, garlic powder, onion powder…I don’t remember the measurements, I just throw them in and it’s never been an issue. Measure with your heart
3 Tbsp nutritional yeast
1 can chickpeas
1 cup vegan cheese shreds

Pulse the cashews and cannellini beans in a food processor a few times
Add the nondairy milk, hot sauce, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and nutritional yeast, blend until smooth
Transfer to a baking dish, drain and add whole chickpeas and 3/4 cup of the cheese, stir to combine
Garnish with the rest of the cheese on top
Bake at 375° for 30 minutes
