[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyzXBIwZnC4)

**CHOPS**:

- 2 8oz/.25kilo bone in pork chops
- 1000g/1L water
- 100g or 1/4c salt
- 50g or 4tbsp sugar
- 30g/2tbsp neutral cooking oil (canola, grapeseed, etc)

- To make the brine, whisk together water, salt and sugar and add 2 chops. Brine in fridge for 2 hours.
- Remove chops from brine and dry all sides well.
- Preheat non-stick pan over medium heat, add oil to pan, then chops. Press chops down well for maximum sear. Flip after 5-6min or until nicely browned on side one. Continue cooking on the second side for around 7-8min, pressing down. Baste around bone with rendered fat in the pan. Pull at 130F/55C.
- Remove chop from pan and and allow it to rest while you make the glaze.

**GLAZE**:

- 1/4 white onion, grated
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 75g or 3 1/2 tbsp  honey
- 75g or 1/4c ketchup
- 25g 1 3/4tbsp hot sauce
- 15g or 1tbsp cider vinegar
- 20g 1tbsp + 1/2tsp worchestershire
- 75g or 1/3c water
**optional: add a splash of molasses & 5-6g chile powder for additional depth and smokiness or to omit the 2nd deglazing

- Stir all ingredients together to combine.
- In a med nonstick pan, add in 1/2 the glaze, cooking over high heat, stirring constantly to reduce until sticky and beginning to caramelize. Deglaze with an additional 75g or 1/3c  water. Stir until reduction is dissolved into the water. Repeat by reducing sauce until sticky and caramelizing**, then deglazing once more with another 75g or 1/3c water. Stir to combine and add pork chops back to pan, basting chops with sauce as the sauce reduces. For chops that are still slightly pink in center, bring to an internal temp of 145F/62C. For no pink, go with 150F/65C.  Allow meat to rest before eating.

**GRITS**:

- 200g or 1 1/4c yellow grits/polenta (i like a finer grind like Bob's Red Mill)
- 700g or 3c chicken stock + extra if needed
- 6g or 1tsp salt
- Additional 150g or 1/2c + chicken stock to finish and bring to desired consistency  
- 75g or 5tbsp unsalted butter
- 125g or about 1c sharp cheddar, shredded
- 50g or 1/2c grated parm

- Preheat saucepan over med-high. Add grits and dry toast while stirring (about 45 sec). Add 700g/3c chicken stock, stir, and bring to a simmer. Cover and reduce heat to low and continue to cook for 25-30min, stirring frequently. Add in more stock if needed to keep moist. When done, stir in salt.
- When ready to serve grits, add back to stove over medium heat, stir in a splash of chicken stock (about 150g or 1/2c) and butter and bring to a simmer.  Stir in cheddar and parm. Season to taste with salt if desired.
