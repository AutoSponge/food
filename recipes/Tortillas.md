# Tortillas

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQbDQIKC9V4&t=4s)

**makes 6 10" tortillas**

- 250g (8.8oz) white bread flour
- 160g (5.65oz) boiling water
- 5g (0.17oz) salt
- 5g (0.17oz) baking powder
- 50g (1.75oz) lard or other fat

1. In a large bowl combine the boiling water, salt, and baking powder. Mix well to dissolve the salt. Add the flour and mix until there is no dry flour left.
1. Cover and rest for 30 minutes.
1. Add the lard and work it into the dough. Squeeze the dough between your fingers. You must really go for it! This will take around 2 minutes. Work the dough in the bowl until the fat is absorbed into it.
1. Tip the dough out onto the table and knead for 5 â€“ 6 minutes.
1. Weight the dough and divide it into 6 equal pieces. Shape into balls.
1. Place the dough balls on a plate or tray and cover. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. This will set the dough and make it easier to roll out. You can leave it in the fridge for longer too. Make them a day ahead of time if you want to.
1. Roll the dough balls out to 25cm (10in) in diameter using a rolling pin and a good dusting of flour. You can stack the tortillas on top of each other if your kitchen is not too humid. If it is, then dust some flour between them to prevent them from sticking together. Alternatively, you can roll them and cook them one by one.
1. Cook in a preheated pan on high heat for no longer than 2 minutes flipping the tortilla every 30 seconds. If you are using an iron pan, then it may take even less time. Do NOT cook it until it has coloured well on both sides as this will take too long. The longer they cook the drier they get. Some darker spots where it bubbles up is all you need.
1. As soon as it comes out the pan cover it to prevent it from drying out. Best served fresh. Enjoy!
