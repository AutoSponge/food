[Source](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/creamy-white-wine-mushroom-stuffed-shells/)

- 1 stick (8 tablespoons) salted butter
- 3  (216 g) shiitake or cremini mushrooms, sliced
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- kosher salt and black pepper
- 1/4 cup (31 g) all-purpose flour
- 2 cups (488 g) milk
- 2 cups (480 g) dry white wine or chicken broth
- 1 cup (112 g) shredded mozzarella cheese
- 3/4 cup (75 g) grated parmesan cheese
- 1 pound (453 g) jumbo pasta shells
- 2 cups (492 g) whole milk ricotta cheese
- 2 cups (264 g) shredded provolone
- 2 (10 ounce packages) frozen spinach, thawed and drained

1. Preheat the oven to 350° F. Grease a 9×13 inch pan.
2. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium pot. Add the mushrooms. Cook undisturbed for 5 minutes or until golden. Add the thyme, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook 4-5 minutes, until fragrant. Remove the mushrooms from the skillet.
3. To the skillet, add the reaming 6 tablespoons butter, the garlic, basil, oregano, and cook 30 seconds or until fragrant. Whisk in the flour and cook for about 1 minute. Add the wine, then the milk. Bring to a boil and stir for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese. Stir until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth. Set the cheese sauce aside.
4. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat and boil the pasta until al dente according to package directions.
5. In a bowl combine the ricotta, provolone, and spinach.
6. Spread 1/3 of the cheese sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Working with one pasta shell at a time, spoon 1 tablespoon of the ricotta mix into each shell, placing the filled shell into the baking dish as you go. Sprinkle over 1/2 cup mozzarella, pour the remaining cheese sauce over top. Top with a 1/4 cup of parmesan and then the mushrooms. Cover and bake 25 minutes or until the top has bubbled up. Remove the foil and bake another 15-20 minutes. Serve with fresh thyme.
