4 dried chili pepper
2 clove garlic
Beef Marinade

1 tsp baking soda

2 tbsp water
1 tbsp Kikkoman® Oyster Sauce (Amazon​)

Sauce

1 tbsp Kikkoman® Oyster Sauce (Amazon​)
1 tbsp Kikkoman® Soy Sauce (Amazon)
0.50 tsp Kikkoman® Tamari Soy Sauce (Amazon)
0.50 tsp chili sauce
1 tsp sugar
1 tbsp cooking wine
Cooking

1 oz oil (to be added first)
2 oz oil (to be added second)
1 tbsp Kikkoman® Sesame Oil (Amazon)

**Steps**

1. Trim the beef (11 oz), cutting away any white, stringy gristle. Then, cut the beef into thin slices across the grain. Rinse the sliced beef in cold water to get rid of excess red myoglobin.
1. Mix baking soda (1 tsp), cornstarch (1 tbsp), water, oyster sauce (1 tbsp), light soy sauce (1 tsp), dark soy sauce (1 tsp), and white pepper powder (0.25 tsp) together in a bowl
1. Squeeze the excess water out from the rinsed beef slices. Add the beef slices into the marinade, and mix well.
1. Slice the onion (1 medium) into 1/4" thick slices, and loosen the slices apart.
1. Chop the green onion (5 stalks) into 1 inch pieces. Separate the white parts from the green parts.
1. Smash, peel, and mince the garlic (2 clove).
1. Cut the green bell pepper (0.50 ) and red bell pepper (0.50 ) into strips.
1. Mix together oyster sauce (1 tbsp), light soy sauce (1 tbsp), dark soy sauce (0.50 tsp), chili sauce (0.50 tsp), sugar (1 tsp), and cooking wine (1 tbsp) in a small bowl.
1. Once the beef has absorbed all of the marinade, add oil (1 tbsp) to the beef and mix it in. Add cornstarch (1 tbsp) to the beef as well and give it another mix.
1. Turn the stove to high heat, and let the wok heat up until it's just about to smoke, or barely smokes.
1. Add oil (1 oz), and swirl it around to coat the wok. Add the rest of the oil (2 oz), and let it heat for about a minute. Add the beef and fry for about 1.5 minutes.
1. Turn off the stove and remove the beef from the wok.
1. Pour out the oil into a separate container. The oil that's remaining in the wok will be enough to finish cooking the rest of this dish.
1. Turn the stove back on, and add the garlic, dried chili pepper (4 ), onion, and green onion whites, and green and red bell peppers. Fry them for about 1 to 1.5 minutes, until fragrant and cooked through.
1. Add the beef back in and stir-fry for about 20 seconds.
1. Add the sauce and the green parts of the green onion. Stir-fry for 30 seconds more, then turn off the heat.
1. Finish by drizzling sesame oil (1 tbsp) over the top and mix to distribute.
