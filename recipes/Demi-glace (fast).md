# Demi-glace (fast)

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WLUMS7Ung)

These are the basic proportions — multiply as needed. I start with six quarts of broth in the video and get 26 ice cubes of demi-glace, each enough to enrich a single portion of pan sauce.

- 1 qt (32 oz, 946mL) low-sodium broth or stock (I've had best results with prepackaged chicken broths, but demi-glace is traditional made with veal stock)
- 1 1/4 oz (7g) packet unflavored, [[Biscuits]] gelatin
- 1 teaspoon (5mL) tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon (5mL) soy sauce, ideally low-sodium
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder (very optional — most prepackaged broth has onion in it already)

Put the tomato paste in a large pot, then turn the heat on medium. Spread the paste around the bottom of the pot and stir until it just barely starts to brown. Deglaze with the broth. Stir in all other ingredients and boil over high heat until reduced to about 1/6th of its original volume. Freeze in ice cub trays.
