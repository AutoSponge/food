1/2 cup (112g) White sugar
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (200g) packed brown sugar I used dark brown sugar
1/2 cup (112g) unsalted butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon (3g) kosher salt
1 whole egg
1 egg yolk
2 teaspoons (6g) vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups (200g)  all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon (4g) baking soda
7 ounces dark chocolate (60-70 percent cacao)

Ingredients:
- 150g (2/3 cup) unsalted butter (if not weighing, melt butter first then measure in liquid measure cup)
- 30g (2 tbsp) cold water
- 100g (1/2 cup) sugar
- 100g (1/2 cup packed) dark brown sugar (light will also work)
- 1 large egg, fridge cold
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp kosher salt (use 1/2 tsp for table salt)
- 175g (1 1/4 cup) all-purpose flour
- 150g (3/4 cup) semi-sweet chocolate chips (sub any chocolate: bitter-sweet or dark chips, chunks, chopped bars, etc)
- Flaky sea salt, for finishing (sub kosher salt, coarse sea salt)

Brown Butter
1. Place butter in a medium stainless teel saucepan. Cook over medium heat, swirling every so often to melt evenly. The butter will start foaming, steaming, and gently popping. This is the water in the butter evaporating.
2. Once the noise quiets down and the foam subsides a little, most of the water has evaporated. At this point, stir constantly, scraping the bottom of the pot so that the milk solids do not stick. 
3. Keep cooking until you see light brown bits at the bottom of the pan and can clearly smell a deeply buttery and nutty aroma.
4. Turn off heat and immediately add the 2 tbsp cold water to the hot browned butter. The butter will sizzle and steam. Transfer butter to a mixing bowl (metal bowl will help with cooling) and set aside for 5-10 minutes to cool. 

Make Dough
1. After the butter has cooled slightly but the bowl is still warm to the touch, add in brown and regular sugar. Whisk to fully combine.
2. Add in egg and vanilla extract. Whisk vigorously for 1 minute until the mixture lightens in colour and thickens slightly.
3. Add baking soda and salt. Whisk for 15 seconds to distribute evenly.
4. Add flour to bowl and use spatula to stir and fold until the batter is even and there are no dry patches of flour.
5. Add chocolate chips and fold to distribute evenly.

Shape & Chill
1. Use large #20 cookie scoop to portion into dough balls. If rolling by hand, aim for around golf ball size or 3 tbsp (just under 1/4 cup). The dough will be slightly soft and sticky but still shapeable into rough balls. Use slightly wet hands to help with sticking (but honestly just embrace the stickiness and power through haha). If the dough is too soft to work with, chill for 30 minutes and try again. The recipe makes roughly 12 golf ball sized dough balls (but sometimes I get 11, depending on how much of the cookie dough I snack on).
2. Place all the dough balls close together on a lined cookie sheet. Cover and chill in fridge for 30 minutes minimum, up to 48 hours. The dough can also be frozen. After the balls harden in the fridge, transfer to a freezer bag and keep up to 3 months. Bake straight from frozen but add 2-3 minutes to the baking time.

Bake
1. Pre-heat oven to 350F (175C) with rack in the centre.
2. Place max 6 frozen dough balls on one lined cookie sheet. Sprinkle lightly with flaky salt.
3. Bake one tray at a time for 10-12 minutes at 350F. When ready, the outside of the cookies will be lightly browned and crinkly. The centre will be blonde and puffed up.
4. Cool on tray for 5-10 minutes then transfer to wire rack to cool completely before serving.

# Chocolate Chip Cookies (2-day)

[Source](https://youtu.be/h4CyhQqAPpk?si=Xlnz3xMfGX-QY8mM)

9 cookies

TOFFEE

- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ¾ cup light brown sugar, lightly packed
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- water, as needed

COOKIE DOUGH

- 1 cup unsalted butter
- 4 ice cubes
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- 1 ½ cups dark brown sugar, packed
- 2 teaspoons espresso powder
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 ½ cups all purpose flour
- 6 oz cacao chocolate, 50-70% cacao, chopped
- flaky sea salt, for sprinkling

**Preparation**
Make the toffee: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium nonstick saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, brown sugar, and salt, stirring until evenly incorporated. If there are grainy lumps or if the fat starts to separate, add a couple splashes of water and stir vigorously to emulsify. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 290°F (143°C), about 10-15 minutes.
Pour the toffee onto the prepared baking sheet and spread out slightly with a spatula. Freeze until ready to use, about 30 minutes.
Make the cookie dough: Add the butter to a medium nonstick saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter turns dark brown and smells nutty. Watch carefully so the butter does not burn. Remove the pot from the heat.
Add an ice cube to the butter and slowly let it melt. It may froth and bubble. Add the remaining 3 ice cubes and gently stir until melted.
In a large bowl, combine the granulated and brown sugar, espresso powder, salt, and baking soda.
Pour the brown butter into the sugar mixture and mix until combined. Don’t worry if it looks separated.
In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and vanilla. Pour into the sugar and butter mixture and whisk until glossy and smooth.
Add the flour and fold with a rubber spatula to incorporate until the dough has no visible flour streaks.
Remove the toffee from the freezer (it should be a frozen disc) and break it into chunks that will fit inside a gallon zip-top bag. Double bag the toffee and seal both bags. With a rolling pin, break the toffee into small pieces.
Fold the crushed toffee and chopped chocolate into the dough until evenly distributed.
Using a large ice cream scoop or a ½ cup (65 g) measure, scoop the dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Wrap the baking sheet in plastic wrap, but leave a small opening at the corner of the tray. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 36 hours. This will allow the flavor to develop and the dough to dry out a little as it rests, which will result in less spread when it bakes.
When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). Line 2 baking sheet with parchment paper.
Arrange the cookies on the baking sheets, leaving at least 2 inches (5 cm) of space between the cookies and away from the edges of the pan.
Bake until the cookies are golden brown with crispy edges, but are still slightly soft in the center, 18-20 minutes.
Immediately sprinkle the cookies with flaky sea salt. then let cool completely. The cookies will be very soft at first but will set after they are fully cooled.
Enjoy!
