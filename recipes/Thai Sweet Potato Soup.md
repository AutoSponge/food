- 2 cups peeled and diced carrots
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 3 cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup coconut milk

**Directions**

1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add curry paste, Sriracha sauce, ginger, and garlic; saute until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in sweet potatoes and carrots; season with kosher salt and pepper.
2. Add vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until vegetables are fork tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn off the heat and puree with an immersion blender until soup is smooth. Stir in coconut milk and adjust seasoning, if necessary.

**INGREDIENTS**
*Soup*

- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 2 cups chopped yellow (sweet) onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- 2 tablespoons red curry paste
- 4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth, plus more if needed
- ¼ cup raw almond butter or peanut butter
- 3 cups diced peeled carrots
- 3 cups diced peeled sweet potatoes
- ½ teaspoon fine-grain sea salt, plus more to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Up to ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, if you like spice)

*Toppings*

- Minced fresh cilantro
- Fresh lime juice
- Roasted tamari almonds (optional, see below)

*Roasted tamari almonds*

- ½ cup raw almonds, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon low-sodium tamari or coconut aminos

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. To make the soup: In a large pot, melt the coconut oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger and sauté for 5 to 6 minutes, until the onion is translucent.
1. Stir in the curry paste. In a small bowl, whisk together some of the broth with the almond butter until smooth. Add the mixture to the pot, along with the carrots, sweet potatoes, salt, and remaining vegetable broth. Stir until combined.
1. Bring the soup to a low boil over medium-high heat and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until the potatoes and carrots are fork-tender.
1. Ladle the soup carefully into a blender. You will likely have to do this in a couple of batches, depending on the size of your blender (never fill your blender past the maximum fill line). Being careful to avoid hot steam escaping from the lid, blend on low and slowly increase the speed until the soup is completely smooth. (Alternatively, you can use an immersion blender and blend the soup directly in the pot.)
1. Taste, and season with salt and black pepper. If you’d like more spice, add a pinch or full ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, and blend again. Transfer the soup back to the pot and reheat if necessary. If desired, you can thin the soup out with a bit more broth if it’s too thick for your preference.
1. Ladle the soup into bowls and top with minced cilantro, a squeeze of lime juice, and optional tamari almonds. This soup will keep in the fridge for up to a week, and freezes well for 1 to 2 months.
1. To make the roasted tamari almonds: Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
1. In a medium bowl, toss the almonds with the tamari until the almond pieces are fully coated. Spread the almonds over the prepared baking sheet in an even layer.
1. Roast the almonds for 9 to 12 minutes, until lightly golden. The tamari will have dried up.
1. Let cool completely on the pan. The almonds will harden up as they cool. Using a spoon, scrape the almonds off the parchment paper and enjoy! Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for a couple of weeks.
