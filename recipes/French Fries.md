# French Fries

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dklh4oKifVQ)

Ingredients:

- 6 medium russet potatoes, peeled & sliced into 1/4” thick fries
- Vinegar - 15 ml per 1 liter of water (1 tbsp to 4 cups)
- 1 liter (32 oz) Peanut oil (or enough for 2 inches of oil)
- Coarse kosher salt

Method:

1. Set a pot of water over high heat and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, peel and cut the potatoes into roughly 1/4 inch thick fries.
1. Add 2 large pinches of salt, vinegar, and potatoes to the boiling water. Boil until the potatoes are fully tender but not falling apart, about 10 minutes. Set a paper-towel-lined baking sheet on the right.
**Note**: The vinegar creates an acidic environment that slows down and prevents the breakdown of pectin so the potatoes will not turn into mashed.
1. Drain and spread the potatoes on the paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Allow to dry for at least 5 minutes.
1. Add the peanut oil to a large wok and bring to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Meanwhile, set up the fry station by placing the boiled fries on the left and another paper towel-lined baking sheet to the right of the wok.
1. Separate the fries into three small batches. Using a spider or slotted spoon, gently lower the fries into the hot oil. Fry each batch for 50 seconds (set a timer) and let drain on the separate paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat the process for the remaining two batches and let the fries cool for 30 minutes or in the freezer before the second fry.
**Note**: The fries can be kept in the freezer in a ziplock bag or airtight container for on-demand french fries in step 6.
1. Return the oil to 400 degrees Fahrenheit over high heat.  Meanwhile set up the fry station by placing the potatoes on the left, and a metal bowl with a paper towel on the right.
1. Gently lower half of the fries into the hot oil. Fry until they are crisp, lightly golden brown and floating, about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain the fries, move to the paper towel-lined bowl and immediately season with salt. The cooked fries can be kept hot and crisp on a wire rack set on a baking sheet in a 200°F oven while you cook the second batch. Enjoy.
