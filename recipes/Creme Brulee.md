# Creme Brulee

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d5itWdDe24)

Ingredients (6 servings)

- 500g of 30% fat cream (ratio 5pt)
- 100g of full fat milk (ratio 1pt)
- 90g sugar (ratio 1pt)
- 100g of mostly egg yolks but also a little bit of white (just for structural purposes) (ratio 1pt)
(for reference : 1egg = 60g and 1 egg yolk = 20g)
- 2 vanilla pods
(if you can’t get that, ’s a shame really, but get vanilla extract made from REAL vanilla otherwise it sucks)
- For torching : Demerara sugar / Brown sugar

**Steps**

## Vanilla Milk (non alcohol option)

1. Cut open vanilla pods, scrape the seeds, cut remaining pods in 1 inch chunks.
1. Drop everything in hot/simmering milk.
1. Turn off the heat, leave it there until it cools down.
1. Refrigerate overnight.
1. Next day, strain to get the pods out. It will still be beautifully dotted with vanilla seeds.

## Vodka/Rum option

1. Cut open vanilla pods, scrape the seeds, cut remaining pods in 1/2 inch chunks.
1. Add to a container and cover with a bit of alcohol. I used vodka because it’s pretty neutral, but Rum obviously fits the flavour profile of creme brulee better.
1. Leave overnight to infuse. By the next day that liquid should be caramel colored.

## Brulee

1. Big bowl, add milk and sugar. Mix.
1. Add the rest, mixing now and then. Don’t whisk and try to incorporate any air. No foam, no meringue, please. The end silky texture depends on it.
1. Fill ramequins or any wide shallow oven proof containers to 3/4 of the height.
1. Cook for 1.5+ hours at 100°C / 210°F.
1. They should still be a lil wobbly out of the oven.
1. Refrigerate for a few hours until completely chilled.
1. Saturate the top with brown sugar. The swipe away the excess, tilting and turning the ramequin on the side. This is the right of sugar to create a thin and brittle caramel. You want it to be thicker, then don’t swipe away the excess.
1. Torch the demerara sugar until it melts in little puddles. Don’t worry, it will be one piece in the end. I have done under the broiler/grill, it works but it’s easier to burn the top, as you want it super close to the resistance, otherwise you’ll mess up with the delicate cooking/texture of the custard. It should be brittle, delicate yet solid under light pressure.
