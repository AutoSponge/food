**For the dough (makes 4 large pita)**:

- 250g (8.8oz) white bread flour
- 5g (0.17oz) salt
- 3g (0.1oz) instant dry yeast or 3.6g (0.12oz) active dry yeast or (0.3oz) 9g fresh yeast

- 25g (0.9oz) olive oil

Olive oil for cooking

1. In a large bowl combine the water, yeast, salt, sugar, thyme, and olive oil. Mix well. Add the flour and mix to a dough.
1. Tip the dough out on the table and knead it for 5 minutes. *Desired dough temperature 25C (77F). If your dough is warmer, then it will ferment more rapidly. If it is cooler, then it will take longer. Adjust proofing time accordingly.
1. Cover and ferment for 2 hours.
1. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and shape into balls.
1. Cover and final proof for 1 â€“ 1.5 hours.
1. To roll out the pita dust a dough ball with flour generously. Flatten it by hand and then continue with a rolling pin.
1. Drop the pita in a pre-heated pan on medium-high heat with a little bit of oil in it.
1. Cook for 1 minute per side.
1. Stack the pitas on top of each other and cover them as soon as they come out of the pan.
