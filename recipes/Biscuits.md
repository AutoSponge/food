# Biscuits

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoFkDmTm2uc&t=790s)

Cake flour or pastry flour will make lighter biscuits.

1 cup of flour makes ~ 3 biscuits.

For every cup of flour add 1.5 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp kosher salt. Add buttermilk (same amount by weight as the flour (~5 oz = 1 cup).

For deeper color on biscuits, brush with melted butter or heavy cream before baking.

400 preheated oven for 12-15 minutes

Gravy = equal parts fat and flour to make a roux (2-3 min) and milk. 1 cup milk = 1 Tbsp flour = 1 Tbsp butter/fat
(heavy cream has lots of fat so use less butter/fat)
(cold milk prevents lumps)
bechamel: always whisk in liquid slowly making sure it's fully incorporated.
Bring to a boil to fully thicken and simmer for flavors to meld and reach desired thickness. Add black pepper and seasonings.

- 4 cups all-purpose flour (480g)
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 cup very cold butter cubed (227g)
- 1⅓ cups cold milk (320mL)

**Instructions**
Preheat the oven to 425F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Toss in the cubed butter to coat with flour. Using a pastry blender or by rubbing the butter pieces between your fingers, work the butter into the flour until the butter pieces range in size from peas to almonds.
Using a silicone spatula, fold the milk into the flour mixture until most of the flour is moistened but the dough is still crumbly. (Don’t over mix it. It will come together in the next step.) Turn out onto a well-floured surface.
With floured hands, pat the dough to a 1-inch thick rectangle. Fold the dough in half. (A bench scraper or large spatula can be helpful here!) Cut the dough in half crosswise and stack the two halves on top of each other. Pat the dough into a rectangle again. Repeat folding, cutting, stacking, and patting 3 more times.
Roll the finished dough to about ¾ to 1-inch thickness and cut into biscuits using a 2½ to 3-inch round floured cookie cutter. Place on prepared baking sheet. For best results, freeze the biscuits for 20 minutes.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the tops and bottoms are golden brown. Immediately brush with melted butter, if desired. Enjoy hot or cool completely on a wire rack. While biscuits are best fresh from the oven, you can store them at room temp for up to 3 days.

- 2 1/2 cups [[white-lilly]] self-rising flour plus more for dusting
- 1-2 teaspoons sugar (1 will just enhance browning, 2 you'll start to taste)
- 1 stick salted butter (or unsalted plus 1/4 teaspoon salt), FROZEN SOLID
- 1 cup [[buttermilk]], cold
- Melted butter to brush the tops

**Instructions**

1. Pre-heat oven to 475 F.
2. Measure out the flour and sugar into a mixing bowl.
3. Grate the frozen butter with the big holes on a box grater, toss the butter in with the flour, and put the bowl in the freezer for 15 minutes.
4. Barely mix in the buttermilk, and turn the resulting disaster out onto a well-floured surface.
5. Mold it into a big lump, flour the surface, and roll it out to an inch thick.
6. Flour the surface, fold it over on itself, and roll it out again.
7. Repeat for a total of four folds and roll it out to an inch a final time.
8. Punch the biscuits out with a sharp circular cutter (or you can just cut them into squares with a knife). Remember the biscuits you make from the trimmings won't be as good. Put the biscuits on a parchment-lined baking sheet, brush them with melted butter, and bake until puffy and golden, about 15 minutes.
