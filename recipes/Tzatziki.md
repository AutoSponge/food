# Tzatziki

[Source](https://www.chainbaker.com/greek-pita/)

**makes 2 portions**:

- 200g (7oz) Greek yogurt
- 1 garlic clove, finely chopped
- 1/3 cucumber, deseeded and grated
- 20g (0.7oz) olive oil
- 2g (0.07oz) salt
- Chopped dill. The amount is up to you. I like to use quite a lot.

Mix everything and leave in the fridge.
