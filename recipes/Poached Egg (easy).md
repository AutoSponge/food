[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrq3iZcvHAw)

- 3 eggs
- 1 cup white vinegar
- 1 cup water

1. Crack eggs into vinegar mixture. Ensure that the egg is touching the vinegar all over.
2. Soak for about 10 minutes until the whites have started to turn opaque.
3. Bring 3 inches of water to a bare simmer (small bubbles and steam)
4. carefully place eggs into the water and cook for 2-3 minutes until set (soft yolk).
5. Remove with a slotted spoon onto a towel (not paper because it can stick).

For premade eggs, cook to 2 minutes (slightly under done). Place on sheet pan with a little water and cover. Cook in a 350 oven for 3-4 minutes to set whites.
