# Fresh Tomato Sauce

[Source](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/11072-fresh-tomato-sauce?)

**Makes 5 cups (for 2 lbs of pasta)**:

- 5 pounds ripe tomatoes, cored
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- salt
- 1 cup fresh basil leaves, shredded

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Cut tomatoes in half along equator. Set fine-mesh strainer over medium bowl. Gently squeeze tomato halves, cut sides down, over strainer to collect seeds and jelly, scraping any seeds that cling to tomatoes into strainer. Using rubber spatula, press on seeds to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard seeds. Set aside 1 cup liquid and transfer any remaining liquid to large bowl.
1. Cut tomatoes into rough 1½-inch pieces. Working in 2 or 3 batches, process tomatoes in blender until smooth, 30 to 45 seconds; transfer puree to large bowl with strained liquid (you should have about 10 cups puree).
1. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic, pepper flakes, and oregano and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato puree and 1 teaspoon salt. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 4 cups, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
2. Remove pot from heat and stir in basil, reserved tomato liquid, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Season with salt to taste. Use immediately or let cool completely before refrigerating or freezing. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 3 months.)
