# Pickled Red Onions

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VPkezPD0EE)

**ingredients**:

- Red onions
- White vinegar
- Lime
- salt
- sugar

Slice a red onion into thin wedges from tip to root. Cover them about 2/3rds of the way up with room temperature vinegar plus a little lime juice (and maybe some water if you like them less tart), a pinch of salt, a handful of sugar, and maybe a few spices. Throw them in the fridge and stir once or twice over the next few hours. They'll be pickles in about a day. Keep in the fridge for a week or two.
