# Coconut Panna Cotta

Source

12 serving cups or greased molds

**INGREDIENTS**

- 2 packets gelatin
- 0.5 cup water
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 4.5 cup coconut milk
- 4 tsp vanilla extract

**Steps**

1. (optional) grease molds with pan spray or coconut oil
2. sprinkle the gelatin over water. Stir gently and allow the gelatin to bloom for 10 minutes
3. place the cream, brown sugar, and coconut milk in a saucepan. Heat gently while stirring to mix in the sugar completely
4. When the milk mixture is just starting to steam (DO NOT BOIL), remove the saucepan off the heat, and add the bloomed gelatin and stir to completely dissolve the gelatin. Then stir in the vanilla.
5. Place the serving cups or molds on a small tray that will fit in your fridge. Pour the milk mix evenly into the cups/molds - about 1/2 cup of liquid per serving. Allow the pana cotta to cool down, and then cover the serving cups with plastic wrap. Place the tray in the fridge overnight to set. These can be made up to 3 days in advance, but keep the panna cotta covered in the fridge during that time.
